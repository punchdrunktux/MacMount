## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Security-Critical Components (Immediate)
1. SecurePasswordField unit tests
2. BookmarkManager unit tests with mocks
3. SecureCredentialManager tests with keychain mocking

### Phase 2: Core Services (Next)
1. MountService tests with system call mocking
2. NetworkMonitor tests with network state mocking
3. AppState comprehensive tests

### Phase 3: Integration & UI (Following)
1. Mount workflow integration tests
2. UI test automation for key flows
3. Performance baseline establishment

### Phase 4: Continuous Testing (Ongoing)
1. Test maintenance and updates
2. Coverage monitoring
3. Performance regression detection

## Mock Strategy

### System Dependencies
- NetFS.framework calls → Mock mount operations
- Keychain Services → In-memory mock storage
- FileManager → Mock file system operations
- Network.framework → Mock network states

### External Services
- VPN detection → Configurable mock states
- Mount detection → Predefined mount scenarios

## Test Utilities

### Common Test Helpers
- `XCTestCase+AsyncTesting`: Async/await test helpers
- `MockFactory`: Common mock object creation
- `TestConstants`: Shared test data
- `PerformanceBaseline`: Performance measurement utilities

### Test Data Builders
- `ServerConfigurationBuilder`: Fluent API for test data
- `MountStateBuilder`: State scenario creation
- `NetworkStateBuilder`: Network condition simulation

## Success Criteria
- All security-critical tests pass
- No memory leaks detected
- Performance within defined baselines
- UI tests cover happy paths and key error states
- Integration tests validate system boundaries
